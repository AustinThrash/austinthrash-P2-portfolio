title: "About me"
---

Hey there, I'm Austin Thrash. I grew up in Amarillo, Texas, and went to a high school with *just* 71 classmates. It was during those years that I fell in love with computer science and decided to chase my dreams in tech.

After high school, I moved to San Antonio to study at The University of Texas at San Antonio, where I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science. During my undergrad, I discovered a passion for data science, which led me to pursue an MSDA.

Throughout my graduate studies, I've worked on a variety of projects, from market segmentation to predictive modeling using neural networks. I'm excited to keep learning new methods and techniques to sharpen my data analysis skills even more.

## Links

I couldn't really find anything that I thought was too interesting, however I want to recommend the book we used last semester, "An Introduction to Statistical Learning". I found it super useful in most situations.

I also had already created a portfolio website during my computer science degree if you'd like to check that out as well!
